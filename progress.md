# Eye of Horus — Progress Log

## Latest Update
**2026-05-27 — Analytics auto-sync schedule, per-integration rescan buttons, and sync stats UI.**

### What was done this session

#### DB migration — `supabase/migrations/20260527100000_integration_sync_tracking.sql`
- Added columns to `site_integrations`: `ga_sync_count_today`, `ga_sync_count_total`, `ga_last_synced_at`, same for `gsc_` and `clarity_` prefixes, plus `clarity_daily_limit` (default 10) and `sync_counts_date` (used to reset today counters on new UTC day).
- Seeded `analytics_sync_time = "02:00"` key into `global_settings`.

#### New API — `app/api/analytics/sync-one/route.ts`
- `POST { siteId, source: "ga"|"gsc"|"clarity" }` — runs one integration sync, writes a snapshot row, and increments `*_sync_count_today`, `*_sync_count_total`, `*_last_synced_at` on `site_integrations`.
- Enforces Clarity daily limit (429 when limit hit). Resets today counters automatically when `sync_counts_date` differs from today UTC.

#### Updated `app/api/analytics/snapshot/route.ts`
- Now fetches and returns `syncStats` (today/total/lastSyncedAt per source, plus `clarityDailyLimit`) alongside existing ga/gsc/clarity/integration data.

#### Updated `app/api/cron/daily/route.ts`
- Added full analytics sync loop after site checks: reads `analytics_sync_time` from `global_settings`, checks ±30-minute window, then syncs GA4/GSC/Clarity for every site that has credentials. Updates counters. Respects Clarity daily limit. Results included in cron response payload as `analyticsSync`.

#### Updated `app/api/admin/settings/route.ts`
- Added `analytics_sync_time` to the list of allowed setting keys.

#### IntegrationsTab — `app/(dashboard)/sites/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added `SyncStatsPill` component: shows "Last synced X ago", "Today: N×", "Total: N".
- Added `ClarityBalance` component: progress bar showing N / limit calls used today with colour-coded fill (green → amber → red).
- Each analytics integration card (GA4, GSC, Clarity) now shows the stats strip and a **Sync now** button when connected. Button calls `/api/analytics/sync-one` and updates counters optimistically. Clarity button auto-disables when daily limit is reached.
- Scan feedback messages appear below each card (green for success, red for error/limit).
- New `syncStats` prop passed from parent into `IntegrationsTab`.

#### Settings page — `app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx`
- Added **Analytics auto-sync** card in Sites & scanning section.
- Time picker (HH:MM) bound to `analyticsSyncTime` state, reads from `global_settings` on load, saves via `POST /api/admin/settings`.
- "Sync all sites now" manual trigger button.
- Note about updating `vercel.json` to match the configured time.
- Fixed `SettingRow` component to accept `React.ReactNode` for the `desc` prop (was `string`).

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors.

**2026-05-27 — Removed all demo data; real analytics/GSC data rendering; sync status card; re-scan refresh fixed.**

### What was done this session

#### Demo data purge — `app/(dashboard)/sites/[id]/page.tsx`
- **SSL fallback** — removed `site.id === "acme"` hardcoded branch. When no SSL check data exists, shows "No SSL data yet".
- **AnalyticsTab** — removed all hardcoded Acme Finance GA data (`traffic28` array, static KPI values, fake page rows, channel bars, device split, funnel, countries, hardcoded "GA4 connected · Property G-XJ8FZP" header). Replaced with real rendering from `snapshot.ga.metrics` (`GAMetricsType`): users, sessions, pageviews, avg session, top pages, channels, devices, countries. Previous-period deltas computed dynamically. Shows "not connected" banner when no GA property configured; "no data yet" prompt when connected but no snapshot exists.
- **SeoTab** — removed all hardcoded GSC data ("sc-domain:acmefinance.co.za", 14,820 clicks, 284k impressions, static query rows, keyword movement table, technical SEO checklist, backlink profile, page indexing cells). Replaced with real rendering from `snapshot.gsc` (`GSCMetricsType`): clicks, impressions, CTR, avg position, top queries table, striking-distance AI callout. Same connected/no-data states as AnalyticsTab. Added `gscMetrics`, `gscQueries`, `gscDelta` variables.
- **Removed unused components** — `FunnelStep`, `KwShift`, `SeoCheck`, `IndexCell` deleted (were only used by mock sections).

#### Data sync visibility — `app/(dashboard)/sites/[id]/page.tsx`
- **New `SyncSource` component** — shows a traffic-light dot (green = has data, amber = connected but no data, grey = not connected), the source label, a relative time ("2h ago"), and an exact timestamp. Added to Shared Small Components section.
- **New "Data sources" card** on Overview tab — six rows covering Uptime check, WordPress plugin, Google Analytics, Search Console, Microsoft Clarity, Domain check. Each row reads the real `created_at` / `checked_at` from the relevant Supabase snapshot state. This tells the team at a glance when each integration last synced.

#### Re-scan now — refreshes all data sources
- Previously the "Re-scan now" button only called `runScan(site.id)` and `fetchUptimeHistory()`.
- Now awaits `runScan` then runs `Promise.all([fetchUptimeHistory, fetchWpSnapshot, fetchPerfMetrics, fetchFormChecks, fetchDomainCheck, fetchAnalyticsSnapshot])` so every panel reflects the latest data after a scan.

#### Uptime timestamp
- "Last check" cell in the uptime history card changed from time-only (`toLocaleTimeString` → "14:32") to full date + time (`toLocaleString` → "27 May, 14:32") so it is clear whether data is from today or days ago.

#### WordPress stack card (Overview tab) — real data
- PHP version, active theme + version, plugin count / pending updates, and detected forms now read from `wpSnapshot` instead of hardcoded values ("8.2.18", "Astra Pro 4.6.10", "27 active"). Falls back to "—" when no snapshot has been received yet.

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors after all changes.
- `grep` for "acme", "14,820", "284k", "sc-domain", "G-XJ8FZP", "traffic28" in `sites/[id]/page.tsx` returns zero matches.

### Pending
- Run `20260526200000_global_settings.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor if not done yet.
- Run `20260527100000_fix_wordpress_snapshot_rls.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor if not done yet.
- Update `APP_URL` env var in Vercel project to `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app`.

**Previous: 2026-05-27 — Production QA pass: add-client propagation, build blockers, UI click-through.**

### What was done this session
- Ran a production QA pass across the Next.js app after reading the local Next 16 docs in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.
- **`app/(dashboard)/admin/clients/page.tsx`** — fixed the new-client flow so adding a client now also creates the matching monitored `sites` row, logs an activity, and calls `refreshData()`. This makes the new client/site appear across dashboard counts, sidebar navigation, site detail pages, reports, scans, WordPress setup, and settings flows.
- **`app/(dashboard)/admin/clients/page.tsx`** — added URL normalization, deterministic site ID generation, initials/brand defaults, duplicate monitored-site detection, and clearer error handling for add-client failures.
- **`app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx`** — fixed production build blocker where generated report share-link copy called `showToast` from the wrong scope. Copy link now receives a toast callback from the parent.
- **`app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx`** — replaced the `alert()` fallback for "no sites" report generation with the existing inline error UI.
- **`app/(dashboard)/wp/page.tsx`** — fixed production build blocker in CSV export. The page now uses the real `WpUpdate.from` / `WpUpdate.to` fields instead of stale `currentVersion` / `newVersion` names.
- **`app/(dashboard)/wp/page.tsx`** — converted update/export feedback from blocking `alert()` calls to the same toast style used elsewhere.
- **`components/ui.tsx`** — fixed `Sparkline` rendering invalid SVG paths (`NaN`) when it receives a single data point, which happens in low-data or newly-cleared production states.

### Verification
- `npm run build` passes cleanly across all 37 app routes.
- Browser QA with Playwright passed using mocked Supabase/API data so production data was not mutated:
  - Authenticated shell pages rendered without crashes: `/dashboard`, `/admin/clients`, `/settings`, `/reports`, `/wp`, `/regression`.
  - Admin clients add/cancel flow passed.
  - Admin clients add/save flow passed with Supabase writes mocked.
  - Reports tabs, Settings sections, WordPress filters, Sign In, Forgot Password, Request Access navigation, and Request Access submit flow passed.
  - Final mocked browser pass completed with no page errors and no console errors.
- `npm run lint` was run. It still fails due to broader pre-existing project lint issues, mainly strict React hook/compiler rules, old `any` usage, and archived/mockup folders being included. Build and browser QA are green.

### Pending
- Run `20260526200000_global_settings.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor if not done yet.
- Run `20260526100000_fix_rls_recursion.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor if not done yet.
- Update `APP_URL` env var in Vercel project to `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app`.
- Consider a follow-up lint cleanup pass: exclude archived design/scratch folders from ESLint and then fix remaining production app lint errors.

**Previous: 2026-05-26 — Integrations tab + gear icon + global API keys admin.**

### What was done this session
- **`/sites/[id]/page.tsx`** — Added "Integrations" tab (11th tab) to site detail page. Tab reads `?tab=Integrations` from URL param on load. `IntegrationsTab` component handles: WordPress plugin API key (generate/rotate/copy), GA4 Property ID, GSC Site URL, Microsoft Clarity Project ID + API key. Saves to `site_integrations` table via `POST /api/analytics/integrations`.
- **`/admin/clients/page.tsx`** — Added gear icon button on each client row. When a monitored site exists, gear links directly to `/sites/${id}?tab=Integrations`. When no site, gear is shown disabled.
- **`/settings/page.tsx`** — Made sidebar links functional (tracks `activeSection` state). "Integrations" sidebar link now shows `GlobalApiKeysCard` section (OpenAI, Email provider, Twilio/WhatsApp). Other sections show existing content.
- **`/api/admin/settings/route.ts`** — New `GET`/`POST` endpoint for reading/writing global API keys from `global_settings` table. Masked keys (last 4 chars shown after save). Auth required.
- **`/supabase/migrations/20260526200000_global_settings.sql`** — New table `global_settings` (key-value, one row per setting). RLS enabled. Seeds the 7 expected keys.
- Build passes: 0 TypeScript errors.

### Pending
- Run `20260526200000_global_settings.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to create the global settings table.
- Run `20260526100000_fix_rls_recursion.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor if not done yet.
- Update `APP_URL` env var in Vercel project to `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app`.

**Previous: 2026-05-26 — Full QA pass: auth added to all API routes, bugs fixed, build clean.**

### What was done this session (QA)
- **`lib/auth/index.ts`** — added `getApiUser(request)` (server-side JWT validation via Supabase anon client), `unauthorizedResponse()`, and `apiFetch()` (client-side fetch wrapper that attaches Bearer token from Supabase session).
- **All ~20 internal API routes now require auth** — `getApiUser` + `unauthorizedResponse` added to every handler that was previously unauthenticated:
  - `POST /api/checks/run`
  - `GET + POST /api/sites/[id]/key`
  - `GET /api/analytics/snapshot`, `POST /api/analytics/refresh`, `GET + POST /api/analytics/integrations`
  - `POST /api/ai/summary`, `/chat`, `/issue`, `/competitor`, `/marketing-strategy`, `/seo-brief`, `/blog-ideas`
  - `POST /api/alerts/send`, `GET /api/alerts/logs`, `GET + POST /api/alerts/settings`
  - `POST /api/reports/generate`, `GET /api/reports/list`
  - `GET /api/playwright/checks`, `POST /api/playwright/baseline`
- **`GET /api/analytics/integrations`** — select changed from `*` to exclude `clarity_api_key` from response (prevents API key exposure).
- **`app/api/playwright/baseline`** — path traversal fix: `screenshotUrl` now validated against `public/playwright-data/` using `path.resolve()` before any filesystem access.
- **`app/api/wordpress/route.ts`** — `last_scan` was being set to the string `"Just now"` instead of `new Date().toISOString()`. Fixed.
- **`app/api/ai/chat/route.ts`** — removed dynamic `await import('@anthropic-ai/sdk')` inside handler; replaced with static top-level import.
- **Cron routes hardened** — both `/api/cron/daily` and `/api/cron/monthly` now return 401 when `CRON_SECRET` is missing (previously just warned and proceeded).
- **`.npmrc`** — removed `playwright_skip_browser_download=1` (invalid npm config key that caused npm warnings). The env var is already set correctly in `vercel.json`.
- **All frontend fetch calls** — replaced with `apiFetch` in: `context/AppContext.tsx`, `settings/page.tsx`, `sites/[id]/page.tsx`, `reports/page.tsx`, `issues/[id]/page.tsx`.
- Build passes cleanly: 35 routes, 0 TypeScript errors, 0 warnings.

### Pending
- Run `20260526100000_fix_rls_recursion.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor if not done yet.
- Update `APP_URL` env var in mineshwp Vercel project dashboard to `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app`.
- Delete stale `wetpaint` team Vercel project to avoid confusion.

**Previous: 2026-05-26 — Production URL corrected, RLS recursion fixed, session persistence added.**

### What was done this session
- **Correct production URL identified:** `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app` (mineshwp personal Vercel account, auto-deploys from GitHub). The `wetpaint` team Vercel project (`eye-of-horus-2point0.vercel.app`) is stale and should be deleted.
- **`APP_URL` must be updated** in the mineshwp Vercel project env vars to `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app`
- **SignIn.tsx** — removed hardcoded demo credentials (mia.patel@wetpaint.co.za / Horus_2026). Fields now start empty.
- **SignIn.tsx** — removed hardcoded client names from preview-tease (Tarsus, Acme, Gentech). Replaced with generic feature description.
- **`supabase/migrations/20260526000000_clear_seed_data.sql`** — run in Supabase SQL Editor to clear demo data ✅
- **`supabase/migrations/20260526100000_fix_rls_recursion.sql`** — fixes infinite recursion in RLS policies. Created `get_my_role()` SECURITY DEFINER function. Run in Supabase SQL Editor.
- **`lib/supabase.ts`** — added `persistSession: true`, `autoRefreshToken: true`, `detectSessionInUrl: true` to Supabase client config.
- **`app/(dashboard)/admin/clients/page.tsx`** — added `getUser()` session check before client insert to surface session errors clearly.
- **`.npmrc`** — added `playwright_skip_browser_download=1` to prevent Playwright browser download during Vercel build.
- **`vercel.json`** — added `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` env var (belt-and-suspenders alongside .npmrc).
- Super admin profile created in Supabase for minesh@wetpaint.co.za with role=super_admin, status=active.

### Pending
- Run `20260526100000_fix_rls_recursion.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor if not done yet.
- Update `APP_URL` env var in mineshwp Vercel project dashboard to `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app`.
- Delete stale `wetpaint` team Vercel project to avoid confusion.

**Previous: 2026-05-26 — Production-ready: all demo seed data cleared, all pages now fully DB-driven.**

### What was done this session
- Created migration `20260526000000_clear_seed_data.sql` — deletes all demo seed data (Acme Finance, Tarsus, Greenfield, etc.) from `sites`, `issues`, `wp_updates`, `clients`, `activities`. User will add their real clients.
- **AppContext** (`context/AppContext.tsx`) — removed all hardcoded "Mia Patel", "mia.patel@wetpaint.co.za", "Director · Wetpaint" references. Now fetches `profiles` table after Supabase auth to get the logged-in user's real name and role. Timestamps use real `toLocaleTimeString()` instead of "Just now".
- **Dashboard** (`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`) — KPI deltas now compute from live data (e.g. critical count, healthy count). Sparklines reduced to current value instead of hardcoded fake history. Subtitle text is data-driven.
- **Issue detail** (`app/(dashboard)/issues/[id]/page.tsx`) — owners list now fetched from `profiles` table. Note attribution uses `currentUser.name`. All `i1`/`i2` hardcoded evidence blocks removed; replaced with generic evidence from `issue.evidence` JSONB field. Suggested fix now uses `issue.recommended` from DB.
- **Reports** (`app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx`) — complete rewrite of all tab content. WeeklySummary, PortfolioCards, ClientReady, InternalDev, and Trends tabs all compute from live AppContext data. No hardcoded company names remain.
- **WP updates** (`app/(dashboard)/wp/page.tsx`) — hardcoded history array removed; replaced with live WP-type activities from the activity feed. Recommended order now dynamically sorted by risk and flag from `wp_updates` table.
- **Visual regression** (`app/(dashboard)/regression/page.tsx`) — removed all `selectedSiteId === "acme"` conditionals. Defaults to first real site. Change list shows real visual regression issues from DB. Empty states shown when no baseline or data exists.
- **Settings** (`app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx`) — removed "applies to: Acme Finance", hardcoded "18 pages" badge, "Connected · #wetpaint-alerts", "https://hooks.wetpaint.co.za/horus" webhook URL, and "Configured · test user". All replaced with generic/instructional text.
- TypeScript check passes cleanly (0 errors).

**Previous: 2026-05-26 — Platform is LIVE. All DB migrations applied. Ready for credentials.**

### What was done this session
- Fixed type mismatch in `supabase/migrations/20260523800000_phase8_alerts.sql` — `notification_logs.issue_id` changed from `uuid` to `text` to match `issues.id TEXT` primary key
- All 10 database migrations confirmed applied successfully (Supabase SQL Editor — "Success. No rows returned")
- App deployed to Vercel: `https://eye-of-horus-2point0.vercel.app`
- Vercel env vars set: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, `APP_URL`
- Daily email hook activated in `app/api/cron/daily/route.ts` (guarded — only fires when `ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` is set)
- Helper scripts created: `scripts/run-migrations.ts`, `scripts/build-idempotent-migrations.ts`
- `.env.local` updated with `CRON_SECRET` and `APP_URL=http://localhost:3000`

### Current database state (confirmed via REST API 2026-05-26)
All 25 tables exist and are returning 200: `sites`, `issues`, `wp_updates`, `activities`, `profiles`, `clients`, `client_users`, `access_requests`, `uptime_checks`, `checks`, `performance_metrics`, `wordpress_snapshots`, `playwright_checks`, `playwright_baselines`, `form_checks`, `reports`, `report_schedules`, `analytics_snapshots`, `search_console_snapshots`, `clarity_snapshots`, `site_integrations`, `ai_messages`, `notification_logs`, `alert_settings`, `domain_checks`

**Previous: 2026-05-23 (audit)** — Full project audit completed. All 8 phases + 3 post-phase enhancements are code-complete (38 routes, build passes). Outstanding items before production go-live documented below. Key gap identified: `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` is read by `lib/analytics/google-auth.ts` but was missing from `.env.example` — now added. See "Next Recommended Task" for full deployment checklist.

**Previous: 2026-05-23** — Three post-phase enhancements complete: (1) Domain expiry checks via RDAP — `lib/checks/domain.ts` queries `rdap.org`, strips subdomains (handles `.co.za` etc.), parses expiry from events array, inserts into new `domain_checks` table, deducts from health score (<7d: -25 critical, <30d: -10 high), fires `domain_expiring` alerts. (2) Monthly report auto-generation cron — `app/api/cron/monthly/route.ts` runs on the 1st of each month at 00:30 UTC, calls `compileReport()` directly per site in batches of 3, inserts `reports` rows with `status: 'ready'`, sends completion email to `ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS`. `vercel.json` created. (3) Client-facing report portal — `app/(portal)/` standalone layout with `portal/login/page.tsx` (Supabase email/password auth, role-gated to `client`) and `portal/reports/page.tsx` (shows assigned client's monthly reports, links to `/report/[token]` for printable view). Build passes cleanly across all 38 routes.

## Current Phase
Live — Awaiting Third-Party Credentials

---

## Current Status
**Platform is fully deployed and all database migrations are applied.** The app loads and runs at `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app` (mineshwp Vercel account, auto-deploys from GitHub pushes). Core monitoring, dashboard, site checks, and issue tracking all work. AI, email, and analytics features are built and wired but will return graceful fallbacks until their API keys are added to Vercel.

Routes live (38 total):
- Phases 1–3: Foundation, monitoring, WordPress plugin
- Phase 4: Playwright QA + visual regression
- Phase 5: Reports (daily email + monthly shareable)
- Phase 6: GA4, Search Console, Clarity analytics
- Phase 7: Full AI layer — 9 routes, chat, summaries, SEO briefs, strategy, blog ideas, competitor
- Phase 8: Email + WhatsApp alerts, dedup, recipient management, notification log
- Post-phase: Domain expiry (RDAP), monthly report cron, client portal (login + report list)

- [x] Build passes cleanly across all 26 routes

### Phase 5 — Reporting ✅
- [x] DB migration — `reports` and `report_schedules` tables + RLS policies (`supabase/migrations/20260523500000_phase5_reports.sql`)
- [x] `lib/reports/types.ts` — `ReportContent`, `Report`, and sub-type interfaces
- [x] `lib/reports/compiler.ts` — pulls live data from Supabase (site info, issues, uptime checks, WP snapshots, Playwright checks, form checks), calculates scores, generates recommendations
- [x] `lib/reports/email-template.ts` — HTML + plain-text daily email builder; `sendEmail()` using Resend API (console fallback when key absent)
- [x] `app/api/reports/generate/route.ts` — POST: inserts a report row, compiles content, builds executive summary, updates to `ready`; returns `shareToken` + `shareUrl`
- [x] `app/api/reports/list/route.ts` — GET: returns paginated report list filtered by `siteId` or `clientId`
- [x] `app/api/reports/share/[token]/route.ts` — GET: public endpoint returns full report by share token (no auth required)
- [x] `app/api/reports/email-daily/route.ts` — POST: compiles reports for all sites in batches of 5, builds email, sends via `sendEmail()`; protected by `CRON_SECRET`
- [x] `app/report/[token]/layout.tsx` — standalone HTML/body layout for public report pages; includes print CSS, metric grid styles, severity badge styles
- [x] `app/report/[token]/PrintButton.tsx` — client component for `window.print()` (server component boundary)
- [x] `app/report/[token]/page.tsx` — server component; fetches report by token, renders executive summary, health metrics, issues, WordPress status, QA checks, recommendations, footer; print-safe
- [x] `app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx` — added "Generated" tab, `GeneratedReports` component, `handleGenerateReport` wired to API, `fetchReports` on mount; all existing tab content preserved unchanged
- [x] `app/api/cron/daily/route.ts` — added commented Phase 5 hook to trigger daily email after site checks
- [x] Build passes cleanly across all 22 routes (zero TypeScript errors)

### Phase 4 — Playwright QA ✅
- [x] DB migration — `playwright_checks`, `playwright_baselines`, `form_checks` tables + RLS policies (`supabase/migrations/20260523400000_phase4_playwright.sql`)

- [x] `playwright/checks/visual-regression.ts` — pixelmatch diff, crops to min dimensions, saves diff PNG, returns `DiffResult`
- [x] `playwright/checks/site-check.ts` — full single-site/single-device check: HTTP status, load time, page title, meta description, noindex, H1, navigation, console errors, network errors, forms detection, screenshot, baseline set/compare
- [x] `playwright/runner.ts` — fetches all sites from Supabase, checks each on 3 devices (2 in parallel), writes `playwright_checks`, creates deduplicated `issues`, logs `form_checks`
- [x] `app/api/playwright/checks/route.ts` — GET endpoint; returns check history + baselines for a site
- [x] `app/api/playwright/baseline/route.ts` — POST endpoint; copies screenshot to baseline slot on filesystem + upserts `playwright_baselines`
- [x] `package.json` — added `playwright`, `pixelmatch`, `pngjs`, `dotenv` as devDependencies; added `tsx`; added `check:playwright` script
- [x] `tsconfig.json` — excluded `playwright/` and `wordpress plugin/` directories so Next.js build doesn't require Playwright packages to be installed
- [x] `.gitignore` — added `public/playwright-data/` to prevent screenshots from being committed
- [x] Site detail History tab — device switcher, screenshot + baseline/diff side-by-side, QA signals grid, errors panel, check history feed, "Set as baseline" button
- [x] Build passes cleanly across all 18 routes

- [x] `AppContext.runScan` updated — calls `/api/checks/run` first; falls back to simulation if API unavailable; accepts optional `siteId`
- [x] Site detail page — fetches real `uptime_checks` from Supabase; shows coloured uptime history bar; shows live SSL status; "Re-scan now" triggers real check + refreshes history
- [x] Dashboard "Run full scan" and Topbar refresh icon — use safe `() => runScan()` wrappers (fixes MouseEvent type clash)

## Important Decisions

- **Auth strategy:** Supabase Auth primary; localStorage mock fallback for dev.
- **Sites vs Clients:** `sites` table = monitoring data. `clients` table = business entities. Separate by design.
- **Check execution:** Checks run server-side in Next.js API routes (Node.js runtime). The `tls` module is available because routes use Node.js, not Edge.
- **Concurrency:** All three checks for a site run in parallel (`Promise.all`). Multiple sites batch 3 at a time to avoid hammering servers.
- **Issue deduplication:** Before creating a new auto-generated issue, the orchestrator checks if an open issue with the same `category` and `site_id` already exists. Avoids flooding the issues table on repeated checks.
- **Scoring:** Base 100. Site down: −50. HTTP 4xx: −25. Response > 5s: −15. Response > 3s: −8. SSL invalid: −30. SSL < 7 days: −20. SSL < 30 days: −10. Noindex: −15. No title: −5.
- **RLS on monitoring tables:** `uptime_checks`, `checks`, `performance_metrics` require `auth.uid() IS NOT NULL`. Service role (used in API routes) always bypasses RLS.
- **Simulation fallback:** If Supabase is not configured or the check API fails, `runScan` falls back to a score simulation so the UI stays functional during development.
- **WordPress API endpoint:** Still placeholder — will be wired to `wordpress_snapshots` table in Phase 3 migration.

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# ─── Supabase (required to run at all) ──────────────────────────────────────
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=         # Supabase project → Settings → API

# ─── Email — Resend (Phase 5 + 8) ───────────────────────────────────────────
EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY=           # resend.com → API Keys
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=               # A verified sending domain in Resend
ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=           # Comma-separated team email addresses

## Database / Migration Notes

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor **in order**:

1. `20260522000000_init_schema.sql` — `sites`, `issues`, `wp_updates`, `activities` + seed data
2. `20260523000000_phase1_extended.sql` — `profiles`, `clients`, `client_users`, `access_requests` + seed clients
3. `20260523200000_phase2_monitoring.sql` — `uptime_checks`, `checks`, `performance_metrics` + data retention function

**Cron scheduling** — once Supabase is configured, add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{ "path": "/api/cron/daily", "schedule": "0 2 * * *" }]
}
```
Vercel sends `CRON_SECRET` automatically in the Authorization header.

Future Phase migrations will add:
- `wordpress_snapshots` (Phase 3)
- `form_checks` (Phase 4)
- `reports`, `analytics_snapshots`, `search_console_snapshots`, `clarity_snapshots` (Phase 5/6)
- `ai_messages`, `notification_logs` (Phase 7/8)

---

## API Routes Built

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/checks/run` | GET | Health check |
| `POST /api/checks/run` | POST | Run check for one site (`siteId`) or all sites (`runAll: true`) |
| `GET /api/cron/daily` | GET | Health check (requires CRON_SECRET) |
| `POST /api/cron/daily` | POST | Run all site checks — for schedulers |
| `GET /api/wordpress` | GET | Health check |
| `POST /api/wordpress` | POST | WordPress plugin data receiver (Phase 3 placeholder) |

---

## Commands Run
- `npm install` — dependencies installed
- `npm run build` — ✅ passes across all 38 routes
- `vercel --prod` — ✅ deployed 2026-05-26
- `npx tsx scripts/build-idempotent-migrations.ts` — generates idempotent combined SQL
- All 10 DB migrations applied manually via Supabase SQL Editor ✅

---

## Tests Run
- `npm run build` passes cleanly across all 38 routes.
- Playwright runner not yet executed against production — requires `npx playwright install chromium` then `npm run check:playwright`.

---

## Known Issues / Blockers

- **First super_admin user not yet created.** After signing up via the login page, go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → `profiles` → set `role = 'super_admin'` for your user row.
- **No third-party API keys set yet.** AI, email, and analytics features return graceful fallbacks until keys are added (see Next Recommended Task below).
- **Domain expiry UI panel not built.** The `domain_checks` table is populated by the check runner but no UI card exists yet on the Site Detail page to display days remaining / registrar / expiry date.
- **Playwright form submission testing not implemented.** The runner detects forms on pages but does not yet fill and submit test data.

---

## Next Recommended Task

### Add Remaining API Keys to Vercel (then redeploy)

All keys go in: Vercel Dashboard → eye-of-horus-2point0 → Settings → Environment Variables → Production.
After adding all keys, trigger a redeploy: `vercel --prod` from the project directory.

#### 1. Anthropic (AI features)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — from console.anthropic.com → API Keys

#### 2. Email — Resend
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY` — from resend.com → API Keys
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` — a verified sending address e.g. `alerts@wetpaint.co.za`
- `ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` — comma-separated list e.g. `minesh@wetpaint.co.za,team@wetpaint.co.za`

#### 3. Google Analytics + Search Console
Steps to get `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`:
1. console.cloud.google.com → Create/select project
2. APIs & Services → Library → enable **Google Analytics Data API** and **Google Search Console API**
3. IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create → name it `eye-of-horus-analytics` → download JSON key
4. Stringify: `cat key.json | jq -c .` and paste as `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`
5. In GA4: Admin → Account Access Management → add service account email as Viewer
6. In Search Console: Settings → Users → add service account email as Restricted

Also set:
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROPERTY_ID` — GA4 Admin → Property Settings → Property ID (a number)
- `GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE_SITE_URL` — exact verified URL e.g. `https://wetpaint.co.za/`

#### 4. Create first super_admin user
- Visit `https://eye-of-horus-2point0.vercel.app` → sign up
- In Supabase: Table Editor → `profiles` → set `role = 'super_admin'` for your user

#### 5. Optional — WhatsApp alerts
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM` — from console.twilio.com

#### 6. Optional — Microsoft Clarity
- `CLARITY_API_KEY` — clarity.microsoft.com → Settings → API

#### 7. WordPress Plugin (for each client site)
- Install plugin from `wordpress plugin/extracted/eye-of-horus-client/`
- In dashboard: Sites → [Site] → WordPress tab → Generate Key
- Enter dashboard URL + API key in plugin settings on the WordPress site

#### 8. Playwright QA (run locally when ready)
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run check:playwright
```

#### 9. Two remaining UI features to build
- Domain expiry panel on Site Detail page (table exists, no card yet)
- Playwright form fill + submit testing (detection works, submission not implemented)
