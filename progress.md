# Eye of Horus — Progress Log

## Latest Update
**2026-05-26 — Full QA pass: auth added to all API routes, bugs fixed, build clean.**

### What was done this session (QA)
- **`lib/auth/index.ts`** — added `getApiUser(request)` (server-side JWT validation via Supabase anon client), `unauthorizedResponse()`, and `apiFetch()` (client-side fetch wrapper that attaches Bearer token from Supabase session).
- **All ~20 internal API routes now require auth** — `getApiUser` + `unauthorizedResponse` added to every handler that was previously unauthenticated:
  - `POST /api/checks/run`
  - `GET + POST /api/sites/[id]/key`
  - `GET /api/analytics/snapshot`, `POST /api/analytics/refresh`, `GET + POST /api/analytics/integrations`
  - `POST /api/ai/summary`, `/chat`, `/issue`, `/competitor`, `/marketing-strategy`, `/seo-brief`, `/blog-ideas`
  - `POST /api/alerts/send`, `GET /api/alerts/logs`, `GET + POST /api/alerts/settings`
  - `POST /api/reports/generate`, `GET /api/reports/list`
  - `GET /api/playwright/checks`, `POST /api/playwright/baseline`
- **`GET /api/analytics/integrations`** — select changed from `*` to exclude `clarity_api_key` from response (prevents API key exposure).
- **`app/api/playwright/baseline`** — path traversal fix: `screenshotUrl` now validated against `public/playwright-data/` using `path.resolve()` before any filesystem access.
- **`app/api/wordpress/route.ts`** — `last_scan` was being set to the string `"Just now"` instead of `new Date().toISOString()`. Fixed.
- **`app/api/ai/chat/route.ts`** — removed dynamic `await import('@anthropic-ai/sdk')` inside handler; replaced with static top-level import.
- **Cron routes hardened** — both `/api/cron/daily` and `/api/cron/monthly` now return 401 when `CRON_SECRET` is missing (previously just warned and proceeded).
- **`.npmrc`** — removed `playwright_skip_browser_download=1` (invalid npm config key that caused npm warnings). The env var is already set correctly in `vercel.json`.
- **All frontend fetch calls** — replaced with `apiFetch` in: `context/AppContext.tsx`, `settings/page.tsx`, `sites/[id]/page.tsx`, `reports/page.tsx`, `issues/[id]/page.tsx`.
- Build passes cleanly: 35 routes, 0 TypeScript errors, 0 warnings.

### Pending
- Run `20260526100000_fix_rls_recursion.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor if not done yet.
- Update `APP_URL` env var in mineshwp Vercel project dashboard to `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app`.
- Delete stale `wetpaint` team Vercel project to avoid confusion.

**Previous: 2026-05-26 — Production URL corrected, RLS recursion fixed, session persistence added.**

### What was done this session
- **Correct production URL identified:** `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app` (mineshwp personal Vercel account, auto-deploys from GitHub). The `wetpaint` team Vercel project (`eye-of-horus-2point0.vercel.app`) is stale and should be deleted.
- **`APP_URL` must be updated** in the mineshwp Vercel project env vars to `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app`
- **SignIn.tsx** — removed hardcoded demo credentials (mia.patel@wetpaint.co.za / Horus_2026). Fields now start empty.
- **SignIn.tsx** — removed hardcoded client names from preview-tease (Tarsus, Acme, Gentech). Replaced with generic feature description.
- **`supabase/migrations/20260526000000_clear_seed_data.sql`** — run in Supabase SQL Editor to clear demo data ✅
- **`supabase/migrations/20260526100000_fix_rls_recursion.sql`** — fixes infinite recursion in RLS policies. Created `get_my_role()` SECURITY DEFINER function. Run in Supabase SQL Editor.
- **`lib/supabase.ts`** — added `persistSession: true`, `autoRefreshToken: true`, `detectSessionInUrl: true` to Supabase client config.
- **`app/(dashboard)/admin/clients/page.tsx`** — added `getUser()` session check before client insert to surface session errors clearly.
- **`.npmrc`** — added `playwright_skip_browser_download=1` to prevent Playwright browser download during Vercel build.
- **`vercel.json`** — added `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` env var (belt-and-suspenders alongside .npmrc).
- Super admin profile created in Supabase for minesh@wetpaint.co.za with role=super_admin, status=active.

### Pending
- Run `20260526100000_fix_rls_recursion.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor if not done yet.
- Update `APP_URL` env var in mineshwp Vercel project dashboard to `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app`.
- Delete stale `wetpaint` team Vercel project to avoid confusion.

**Previous: 2026-05-26 — Production-ready: all demo seed data cleared, all pages now fully DB-driven.**

### What was done this session
- Created migration `20260526000000_clear_seed_data.sql` — deletes all demo seed data (Acme Finance, Tarsus, Greenfield, etc.) from `sites`, `issues`, `wp_updates`, `clients`, `activities`. User will add their real clients.
- **AppContext** (`context/AppContext.tsx`) — removed all hardcoded "Mia Patel", "mia.patel@wetpaint.co.za", "Director · Wetpaint" references. Now fetches `profiles` table after Supabase auth to get the logged-in user's real name and role. Timestamps use real `toLocaleTimeString()` instead of "Just now".
- **Dashboard** (`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`) — KPI deltas now compute from live data (e.g. critical count, healthy count). Sparklines reduced to current value instead of hardcoded fake history. Subtitle text is data-driven.
- **Issue detail** (`app/(dashboard)/issues/[id]/page.tsx`) — owners list now fetched from `profiles` table. Note attribution uses `currentUser.name`. All `i1`/`i2` hardcoded evidence blocks removed; replaced with generic evidence from `issue.evidence` JSONB field. Suggested fix now uses `issue.recommended` from DB.
- **Reports** (`app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx`) — complete rewrite of all tab content. WeeklySummary, PortfolioCards, ClientReady, InternalDev, and Trends tabs all compute from live AppContext data. No hardcoded company names remain.
- **WP updates** (`app/(dashboard)/wp/page.tsx`) — hardcoded history array removed; replaced with live WP-type activities from the activity feed. Recommended order now dynamically sorted by risk and flag from `wp_updates` table.
- **Visual regression** (`app/(dashboard)/regression/page.tsx`) — removed all `selectedSiteId === "acme"` conditionals. Defaults to first real site. Change list shows real visual regression issues from DB. Empty states shown when no baseline or data exists.
- **Settings** (`app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx`) — removed "applies to: Acme Finance", hardcoded "18 pages" badge, "Connected · #wetpaint-alerts", "https://hooks.wetpaint.co.za/horus" webhook URL, and "Configured · test user". All replaced with generic/instructional text.
- TypeScript check passes cleanly (0 errors).

**Previous: 2026-05-26 — Platform is LIVE. All DB migrations applied. Ready for credentials.**

### What was done this session
- Fixed type mismatch in `supabase/migrations/20260523800000_phase8_alerts.sql` — `notification_logs.issue_id` changed from `uuid` to `text` to match `issues.id TEXT` primary key
- All 10 database migrations confirmed applied successfully (Supabase SQL Editor — "Success. No rows returned")
- App deployed to Vercel: `https://eye-of-horus-2point0.vercel.app`
- Vercel env vars set: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, `APP_URL`
- Daily email hook activated in `app/api/cron/daily/route.ts` (guarded — only fires when `ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` is set)
- Helper scripts created: `scripts/run-migrations.ts`, `scripts/build-idempotent-migrations.ts`
- `.env.local` updated with `CRON_SECRET` and `APP_URL=http://localhost:3000`

### Current database state (confirmed via REST API 2026-05-26)
All 25 tables exist and are returning 200: `sites`, `issues`, `wp_updates`, `activities`, `profiles`, `clients`, `client_users`, `access_requests`, `uptime_checks`, `checks`, `performance_metrics`, `wordpress_snapshots`, `playwright_checks`, `playwright_baselines`, `form_checks`, `reports`, `report_schedules`, `analytics_snapshots`, `search_console_snapshots`, `clarity_snapshots`, `site_integrations`, `ai_messages`, `notification_logs`, `alert_settings`, `domain_checks`

**Previous: 2026-05-23 (audit)** — Full project audit completed. All 8 phases + 3 post-phase enhancements are code-complete (38 routes, build passes). Outstanding items before production go-live documented below. Key gap identified: `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` is read by `lib/analytics/google-auth.ts` but was missing from `.env.example` — now added. See "Next Recommended Task" for full deployment checklist.

**Previous: 2026-05-23** — Three post-phase enhancements complete: (1) Domain expiry checks via RDAP — `lib/checks/domain.ts` queries `rdap.org`, strips subdomains (handles `.co.za` etc.), parses expiry from events array, inserts into new `domain_checks` table, deducts from health score (<7d: -25 critical, <30d: -10 high), fires `domain_expiring` alerts. (2) Monthly report auto-generation cron — `app/api/cron/monthly/route.ts` runs on the 1st of each month at 00:30 UTC, calls `compileReport()` directly per site in batches of 3, inserts `reports` rows with `status: 'ready'`, sends completion email to `ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS`. `vercel.json` created. (3) Client-facing report portal — `app/(portal)/` standalone layout with `portal/login/page.tsx` (Supabase email/password auth, role-gated to `client`) and `portal/reports/page.tsx` (shows assigned client's monthly reports, links to `/report/[token]` for printable view). Build passes cleanly across all 38 routes.

## Current Phase
Live — Awaiting Third-Party Credentials

---

## Current Status
**Platform is fully deployed and all database migrations are applied.** The app loads and runs at `https://eye-of-horus-2point0-alpha.vercel.app` (mineshwp Vercel account, auto-deploys from GitHub pushes). Core monitoring, dashboard, site checks, and issue tracking all work. AI, email, and analytics features are built and wired but will return graceful fallbacks until their API keys are added to Vercel.

Routes live (38 total):
- Phases 1–3: Foundation, monitoring, WordPress plugin
- Phase 4: Playwright QA + visual regression
- Phase 5: Reports (daily email + monthly shareable)
- Phase 6: GA4, Search Console, Clarity analytics
- Phase 7: Full AI layer — 9 routes, chat, summaries, SEO briefs, strategy, blog ideas, competitor
- Phase 8: Email + WhatsApp alerts, dedup, recipient management, notification log
- Post-phase: Domain expiry (RDAP), monthly report cron, client portal (login + report list)

## Files Modified

### Phase 1
- `README.md` — replaced default Next.js content
- `components/SignIn.tsx` — wired "Request access" to `/request-access`
- `components/Sidebar.tsx` — added Admin section with Clients link

### Phase 2
- `context/AppContext.tsx` — `runScan` now calls `/api/checks/run`; simulation fallback; accepts optional `siteId`
- `app/(dashboard)/sites/[id]/page.tsx` — live uptime history bar from `uptime_checks` table; real SSL badge from latest check; `runScan(site.id)` on Re-scan button
- `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` — `onClick={() => runScan()}` wrapper fix
- `components/Topbar.tsx` — `onClick={() => runScan()}` wrapper fix

### Phase 3
- `app/(dashboard)/sites/[id]/page.tsx` — WordPress tab: live snapshot display, API key generation UI, plugin list, security panel, forms, server info

### Phase 4
- `app/(dashboard)/sites/[id]/page.tsx` — History tab wired with `HistoryTab` component; catch-all placeholder updated to exclude "History"
- `tsconfig.json` — excluded `playwright/` and `wordpress plugin/` from Next.js TS check
- `package.json` — added playwright/pixelmatch/pngjs/dotenv/tsx; added `check:playwright` script
- `.gitignore` — added `public/playwright-data/`

### Phase 5
- `app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx` — added "Generated" tab, GeneratedReports component, real generate/fetch wiring
- `app/api/cron/daily/route.ts` — added commented Phase 5 daily email hook

## Important Decisions

- **Auth strategy:** Supabase Auth primary; localStorage mock fallback for dev.
- **Sites vs Clients:** `sites` table = monitoring data. `clients` table = business entities. Separate by design.
- **Check execution:** Checks run server-side in Next.js API routes (Node.js runtime). The `tls` module is available because routes use Node.js, not Edge.
- **Concurrency:** All three checks for a site run in parallel (`Promise.all`). Multiple sites batch 3 at a time to avoid hammering servers.
- **Issue deduplication:** Before creating a new auto-generated issue, the orchestrator checks if an open issue with the same `category` and `site_id` already exists. Avoids flooding the issues table on repeated checks.
- **Scoring:** Base 100. Site down: −50. HTTP 4xx: −25. Response > 5s: −15. Response > 3s: −8. SSL invalid: −30. SSL < 7 days: −20. SSL < 30 days: −10. Noindex: −15. No title: −5.
- **RLS on monitoring tables:** `uptime_checks`, `checks`, `performance_metrics` require `auth.uid() IS NOT NULL`. Service role (used in API routes) always bypasses RLS.
- **Simulation fallback:** If Supabase is not configured or the check API fails, `runScan` falls back to a score simulation so the UI stays functional during development.
- **WordPress API endpoint:** Still placeholder — will be wired to `wordpress_snapshots` table in Phase 3 migration.

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# ─── Supabase (required to run at all) ──────────────────────────────────────
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=         # Supabase project → Settings → API

GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE_SITE_URL=  # Exact verified URL in Search Console

# ─── Microsoft Clarity (Phase 6) ────────────────────────────────────────────
CLARITY_API_KEY=                  # clarity.microsoft.com → Settings → API

# ─── Email — Resend (Phase 5 + 8) ───────────────────────────────────────────
EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY=           # resend.com → API Keys
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=               # A verified sending domain in Resend
ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=           # Comma-separated team email addresses

# ─── WhatsApp — Twilio (Phase 8) ────────────────────────────────────────────
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=               # console.twilio.com
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=                # console.twilio.com
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM=             # Twilio WhatsApp sandbox or approved sender number

# ─── App ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CRON_SECRET=                      # Any strong random string — protects /api/cron/daily and /api/cron/monthly

# ─── WordPress Plugin ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WORDPRESS_PLUGIN_SECRET=          # Any strong random string
```

**Note:** `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` was missing from `.env.example` and has been added. The code in `lib/analytics/google-auth.ts` reads this variable directly. It should be the full service account JSON file contents as a single-line string.

## Database / Migration Notes

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor **in order**:

1. `20260522000000_init_schema.sql` — `sites`, `issues`, `wp_updates`, `activities` + seed data
2. `20260523000000_phase1_extended.sql` — `profiles`, `clients`, `client_users`, `access_requests` + seed clients
3. `20260523200000_phase2_monitoring.sql` — `uptime_checks`, `checks`, `performance_metrics` + data retention function

**Cron scheduling** — once Supabase is configured, add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{ "path": "/api/cron/daily", "schedule": "0 2 * * *" }]
}
```
Vercel sends `CRON_SECRET` automatically in the Authorization header.

Future Phase migrations will add:
- `wordpress_snapshots` (Phase 3)
- `form_checks` (Phase 4)
- `reports`, `analytics_snapshots`, `search_console_snapshots`, `clarity_snapshots` (Phase 5/6)
- `ai_messages`, `notification_logs` (Phase 7/8)

## API Routes Built

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/checks/run` | GET | Health check |
| `POST /api/checks/run` | POST | Run check for one site (`siteId`) or all sites (`runAll: true`) |
| `GET /api/cron/daily` | GET | Health check (requires CRON_SECRET) |
| `POST /api/cron/daily` | POST | Run all site checks — for schedulers |
| `GET /api/wordpress` | GET | Health check |
| `POST /api/wordpress` | POST | WordPress plugin data receiver (Phase 3 placeholder) |

---

## Commands Run
- `npm install` — dependencies installed
- `npm run build` — ✅ passes across all 38 routes
- `vercel --prod` — ✅ deployed 2026-05-26
- `npx tsx scripts/build-idempotent-migrations.ts` — generates idempotent combined SQL
- All 10 DB migrations applied manually via Supabase SQL Editor ✅

---

## Tests Run
- `npm run build` passes cleanly across all 38 routes.
- Playwright runner not yet executed against production — requires `npx playwright install chromium` then `npm run check:playwright`.

---

## Known Issues / Blockers

- **First super_admin user not yet created.** After signing up via the login page, go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → `profiles` → set `role = 'super_admin'` for your user row.
- **No third-party API keys set yet.** AI, email, and analytics features return graceful fallbacks until keys are added (see Next Recommended Task below).
- **Domain expiry UI panel not built.** The `domain_checks` table is populated by the check runner but no UI card exists yet on the Site Detail page to display days remaining / registrar / expiry date.
- **Playwright form submission testing not implemented.** The runner detects forms on pages but does not yet fill and submit test data.

---

## Next Recommended Task

### Add Remaining API Keys to Vercel (then redeploy)

All keys go in: Vercel Dashboard → eye-of-horus-2point0 → Settings → Environment Variables → Production.
After adding all keys, trigger a redeploy: `vercel --prod` from the project directory.

#### 1. Anthropic (AI features)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — from console.anthropic.com → API Keys

#### 2. Email — Resend
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY` — from resend.com → API Keys
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` — a verified sending address e.g. `alerts@wetpaint.co.za`
- `ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` — comma-separated list e.g. `minesh@wetpaint.co.za,team@wetpaint.co.za`

#### 3. Google Analytics + Search Console
Steps to get `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`:
1. console.cloud.google.com → Create/select project
2. APIs & Services → Library → enable **Google Analytics Data API** and **Google Search Console API**
3. IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create → name it `eye-of-horus-analytics` → download JSON key
4. Stringify: `cat key.json | jq -c .` and paste as `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`
5. In GA4: Admin → Account Access Management → add service account email as Viewer
6. In Search Console: Settings → Users → add service account email as Restricted

Also set:
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROPERTY_ID` — GA4 Admin → Property Settings → Property ID (a number)
- `GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE_SITE_URL` — exact verified URL e.g. `https://wetpaint.co.za/`

#### 4. Create first super_admin user
- Visit `https://eye-of-horus-2point0.vercel.app` → sign up
- In Supabase: Table Editor → `profiles` → set `role = 'super_admin'` for your user

#### 5. Optional — WhatsApp alerts
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM` — from console.twilio.com

#### 6. Optional — Microsoft Clarity
- `CLARITY_API_KEY` — clarity.microsoft.com → Settings → API

#### 7. WordPress Plugin (for each client site)
- Install plugin from `wordpress plugin/extracted/eye-of-horus-client/`
- In dashboard: Sites → [Site] → WordPress tab → Generate Key
- Enter dashboard URL + API key in plugin settings on the WordPress site

#### 8. Playwright QA (run locally when ready)
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run check:playwright
```

#### 9. Two remaining UI features to build
- Domain expiry panel on Site Detail page (table exists, no card yet)
- Playwright form fill + submit testing (detection works, submission not implemented)
